# Arma 3 Utilities
A python project utilising PySimpleGUI aswell as arma 3 tools, mainly meant for batch work.

I'm a novice when it comes to creating projects that are intended for external use.

I acknowledge that a lot can be improved, but as it stands this project is made for my convenience and learning. There are alternatives out there, but they require full setups for small tools.

You may ask, why use standard arma 3 tools for this project if they already work?

Put simply, arma 3 tools are slow. Running them through python allows multiple processes at once, which improves time to completion. (Converting multiple .paa files to .png at once, for instance.)

This is generally better when you are working on big projects. In my experience, it is much easier to have all of these tools linked in a central hub that interconnects with each other.
